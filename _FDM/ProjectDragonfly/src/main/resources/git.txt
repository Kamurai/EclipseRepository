to create a branch
8.do steps 1 and 2 then click on switch to, new branch(place name here) and automaticaly
would change to new branch.
to change of branch repeat step 8 but dont click on new branch, click on the branch that
you want

to push branch repeat steps 1 and 2 then click on push to branch.

to merge i reccomend after creating the branch , right next to the branch name on git fdm there is a button name compare(use it to compare), if the merge is a update
then go ahead. go to gitfdm website and  the branch you are going to merge, there is a button name merge request created. after that merge request tab and accept the merge.
